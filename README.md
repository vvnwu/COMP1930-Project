# COMP1930-Project

We are students of BCIT CST 2019 Winter term. Eco Exchange is our COMP 1930 project, clothing/thrifting/rental website. We created this project as our proposed solution to improve sustainable fashion and address the environmental impact of the fashion industry. We're still pretty new at this so there's still lots to work on!
